# Blogify

Blogify is a package to add a blog to your Laravel 5 application. It comes with a full admin panel with different views for all user roles.
You can generate the public part through an artisan command but feel free to customize it, or just create your own using or models and their scopes.

This is a fork to make some general improvements.
